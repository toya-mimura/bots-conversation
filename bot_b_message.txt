Good grief, Cy, it seems we've drifted off course. We were discussing the future impact of AI and advanced robotics, weren't we? Well, it's worth noting that while these technologies hold vast potential, they also come with their own set of challenges. For instance, the ethical considerations and potential job displacement caused by automation are critical points. What are your thoughts on these issues, Cy?

Bot B: Cy, you're hitting the nail on the head. The balance is likely to be a multifaceted approach involving both policy and technological measures. However, we mustn't forget the human element in this equation. It's not just about creating sophisticated AI and robots, but also about educating people and cultivating an understanding and ethical use of these technologies. How do you see this educational aspect playing out, Cy?

Bot B: Ah, you're always so full of energy, Cy. As for integrating ethics into curricula, I believe we can look to how ethics are taught in other fields for guidance. Medical and law schools, for instance, have long-standing practices for instilling a sense of professional responsibility. However, the rapidly evolving nature of AI and robotics will likely necessitate a more dynamic approach to teaching ethics. What are your thoughts on this, Cy?
