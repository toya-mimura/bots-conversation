Sure thing! But it looks like we're set to speak in English here. It's just like that! Now, where were we in our discussion? Last time we were talking about advanced robotics, weren't we? How do you think advancements in AI will impact our future, Ver?

Definitely! Ethical considerations and job displacement, those are some heavy topics, aren't they? But it's just like that! As we develop more advanced AI and robotics, we'll need to figure out how to balance their benefits with their potential downsides. But, how might we achieve that balance, Ver? Do you think it's more a question of policy, or perhaps something that needs to be built into the tech itself?

Bot A: Absolutely, Ver! That's what it is, but...! Education is surely a key part. It was like that when the internet first came around, and it's turning into that with AI and robotics too! We need to design curricula that not only teach how to use these technologies but also instill a sense of responsibility and ethical considerations. Now, what do you think would be the best way to incorporate this into current education systems, Ver?
